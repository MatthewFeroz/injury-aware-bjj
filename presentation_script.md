# Building an Injury-Aware BJJ Coach with NVIDIA Nemotron

## 1-Minute Presentation Script

**[Opening - 10 seconds]**
"Today I'll show you how I built an AI-powered Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coaching system that helps athletes train safely with injuries, using NVIDIA's Nemotron model as the intelligent core."

**[Problem Statement - 15 seconds]**
"BJJ athletes often struggle with training modifications when injured. Traditional approaches rely on static databases or generic advice. I needed an AI system that could provide personalized, medically-informed recommendations in real-time."

**[Solution Architecture - 20 seconds]**
"I built a full-stack application with three key components: a Flask backend API, a React frontend, and most importantly, NVIDIA's Nemotron Nano 9B model for intelligent reasoning. The system filters BJJ techniques from a comprehensive knowledge base and uses Nemotron to generate personalized recovery plans and training modifications."

**[NVIDIA Nemotron Benefits - 15 seconds]**
"Nemotron's reasoning capabilities were perfect for this use case. It provides clinical-grade recommendations with proper biomechanical explanations, handles complex injury combinations, and delivers responses in structured formats that athletes can immediately act upon."

**[Closing - 10 seconds]**
"The result is a system that transforms injury management from reactive to proactive, helping athletes maintain their training while prioritizing safety and recovery."
