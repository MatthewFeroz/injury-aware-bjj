# Injury-Aware AI Jiu Jitsu Coach

**Injury-Aware AI Coaching** is an open-source prototype demonstrating how AI can help athletes adapt their training when dealing with injuries. The system filters Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) techniques based on a user’s injury and returns moves to **avoid** and **safe alternatives**.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This tool does **not** provide medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional.

## 🚀 Features
- JSON knowledge base of BJJ techniques tagged with injury risks.
- Flask API to query injuries → safe vs unsafe moves.
- Future scope: integrate with NVIDIA Nemotron via NIM for reasoning and recovery advice.
